# Pointers about open science for software science


[awesome-open-science-software](https://github.com/INRIA/awesome-open-science-software) lists resources about open science in research domains with software as main study object (software engineering, programming language, systems software, ...). It's also concerned with software support for open science in general. 

If you'd like to add an item in this awesome list, pull requests are welcome.

* The **[Evaluate Collaboratory](http://evaluate.inf.usi.ch/)** (managed by [Matthias Hauswirth](http://www.inf.usi.ch/faculty/hauswirth/)) is a hub for everybody interested in understanding and improving the state of practice in experimental evaluation in software science.

* The **[Github group "opensciences"](https://github.com/opensciences)** (initiated by Tim Menzies) contains the source of http://openscience.us/, which is an "open science for software engineering portal".

* The **[Artifact Evaluation for Publications Dagstuhl Workshop](http://evaluate.inf.usi.ch/biblio/view/365)** (organized by B. Childers, G. Fursin, S. Krishnamurthi, A. Zeller).

* The **[Engineering Academic Software Dagstuhl Workshop](http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=16252)** (organized by C. Goble, J. Howison, C. Kirchner, O. Nierstrasz).

* **[SoftwareEngineeringToolDemos](https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringToolDemos)** This Github group gathers software prototypes associated with software-engineering publications (maintained by [Emerson Murphy-Hill](http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/ermurph3/) and his students). 

* **[Artifact evaluation](http://www.artifact-eval.org/)** (maintained by [Shriram Krishnamurthi](https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/)) discusses availability of experimental data and reproducibility of experiments. Some conferences and journals start to perform a systematic evaluation of artifacts (eg [Artifact Evaluation at ISSTA'16](https://issta2016.cispa.saarland/artifact-evaluation/)).

* **[Software Engineering Community - Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/collection/user-empirical-software-engineering)** The long-term data archival platform [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) (supported by CERN) is perfectly appropriate for software engineering datasets and benchmarks (up to 4GB). There is a group "Empirical Software Engineering and Mining Software Repositories" for SE/PL data (curated by [Martin Monperrus](http://www.monperrus.net/martin/)).

* The **[Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/)** project collects and preserves software. The project motivation is that "software embodies our technical and scientific knowledge and humanity cannot afford the risk of losing it." (project lead by Roberto Di Cosmo).

* **[dokieli](https://dokie.li/)** is a client-side editor for decentralised article publishing, annotations and social interactions. It can be used to submit scholarly articles in some (Web science) conferences. It implements W3C specifications: Web Annotation, Linked Data Notifications, Activity Streams 2.0. Employs WebID+TLS, Web access control and compliant with Linked Data Platform. Articles and annotations can be assigned with a Creative Commons license. Supports semantic inline citations. Its [source code](https://github.com/linkeddata/dokieli) uses the Apache License, Version 2.0. Maintained by [Sarven Capadisli](http://csarven.ca/#i) ([Github](https://github.com/csarven)) et al.
