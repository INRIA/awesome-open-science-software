# Pointers about open science for software science

[Edit and improve this page!](https://github.com/INRIA/awesome-open-science-software/edit/gh-pages/README.md)

[awesome-open-science-software](https://github.com/INRIA/awesome-open-science-software) lists resources about open science and software:

* software as main experimental tool (aka computational methods)
* software as main study object (software engineering, programming language, systems software, ...). 
* software support for open science (communication, data sharing, etc) 

Software as Experimental Tool 
------------------------------

Software as Study Subject
-------------------------

Software data curation and preservation ([edit to add one](https://github.com/INRIA/awesome-open-science-software/edit/gh-pages/README.md)):

* The [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/) project collects and preserves software. The project motivation is that "software embodies our technical and scientific knowledge and humanity cannot afford the risk of losing it." (project lead by Roberto Di Cosmo).
* [Software Engineering Community - Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/collection/user-empirical-software-engineering) The long-term data archival platform [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) (supported by CERN) is perfectly appropriate for software engineering datasets and benchmarks (up to 4GB). There is a group "Empirical Software Engineering and Mining Software Repositories" for SE/PL data (curated by [Martin Monperrus](http://www.monperrus.net/martin/)).

Others:

* The [Evaluate Collaboratory](http://evaluate.inf.usi.ch/) (managed by [Matthias Hauswirth](http://www.inf.usi.ch/faculty/hauswirth/)) is a hub for everybody interested in understanding and improving the state of practice in experimental evaluation in software science.
* The [Github group "opensciences"](https://github.com/opensciences) (initiated by Tim Menzies) contains the source of http://openscience.us/, which is an "open science for software engineering portal".
* [SoftwareEngineeringToolDemos](https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringToolDemos) This Github group gathers software prototypes associated with software-engineering publications (maintained by [Emerson Murphy-Hill](http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/ermurph3/) and his students).
