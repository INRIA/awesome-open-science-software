# Awesome open science for software and computational science

[Edit and improve this page!](https://github.com/INRIA/awesome-open-science-software/edit/gh-pages/README.md)

[awesome-open-science-software](https://github.com/INRIA/awesome-open-science-software) lists resources about open science and software:

* software as main experimental tool (aka computational methods)
* software as main study object (software engineering, programming language, systems software, ...). 
* software support for open science (communication, data sharing, etc) 

Community
---------

* [Eclipse Science](https://science.eclipse.org): open source and collaboration for computational science.
* [Mozilla Science](https://science.mozilla.org) is a community of researchers, developers, and librarians making research open and accessible.
* [Research Data Alliance](https://www.rd-alliance.org/) (RDA) is a community-driven organization supported by the European Commission, the United States Government's National Science Foundation and National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Australian Governmentâ€™s Department of Innovation with the goal of building the social and technical infrastructure to enable open sharing of data.
* [The Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/)'s mission is to cultivate better, more sustainable, research software to enable world-class research.

Software as Study Subject
-------------------------

Software data curation and preservation ([edit to add one](https://github.com/INRIA/awesome-open-science-software/edit/gh-pages/README.md)):

* The [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/) project collects and preserves software. The project motivation is that "software embodies our technical and scientific knowledge and humanity cannot afford the risk of losing it." (project lead by Roberto Di Cosmo).
* [Software Engineering Community - Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/collection/user-empirical-software-engineering) The long-term data archival platform [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) (supported by CERN) is perfectly appropriate for software engineering datasets and benchmarks (up to 4GB). There is a group "Empirical Software Engineering and Mining Software Repositories" for SE/PL data (curated by [Martin Monperrus](http://www.monperrus.net/martin/)).
* [Journal of Open Source Software - JOSS](http://joss.theoj.org) The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) is a developer friendly journal for research software packages. JOSS papers enable citation of research software packages with a DOI for software that is licensed with as OSI approved open source license, has installation instructions, usage documentation, automated testing, and community contribution guidelines.

Others:

* The [Evaluate Collaboratory](http://evaluate.inf.usi.ch/) (managed by [Matthias Hauswirth](http://www.inf.usi.ch/faculty/hauswirth/)) is a hub for everybody interested in understanding and improving the state of practice in experimental evaluation in software science.
* The [Github group "opensciences"](https://github.com/opensciences) (initiated by Tim Menzies) contains the source of http://openscience.us/, which is an "open science for software engineering portal".
* [SoftwareEngineeringToolDemos](https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringToolDemos) This Github group gathers software prototypes associated with software-engineering publications (maintained by [Emerson Murphy-Hill](http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/ermurph3/) and his students).
